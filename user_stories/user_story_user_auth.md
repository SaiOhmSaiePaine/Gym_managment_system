# User story title: User Registration and Authentication

## Priority: High / 1

This is a fundamental functionality that enables user accounts, secure login, and access control throughout the application.

## Estimation: 4 days (1 day = 5 production hours)

* Sai Ohm Saie Paine: 4
* Linn Thant Soe Wai: 4
* Hlyan Wint Aung: 4

## Assumptions:

* Users must provide valid email addresses for registration.
* Passwords must meet security requirements (minimum length, complexity).
* JWT tokens will be used for session management.
* Users can reset their passwords via email (future enhancement).
* Role-based access control will distinguish between regular users and administrators.

## Description:

As a campus member (student or staff), I want to be able to create an account and securely log in to the Lost & Found system so that I can post found items, claim lost items, and manage my profile. The system should protect my personal information and ensure only authenticated users can access certain features.

## Tasks:

1. **Backend:** Create user registration API endpoint with email validation and password hashing.
2. **Backend:** Implement login API endpoint with JWT token generation.
3. **Backend:** Create middleware for JWT token validation and user authentication.
4. **Backend:** Design user database schema with proper security considerations.
5. **Frontend:** Design and implement registration form with validation.
6. **Frontend:** Design and implement login form with error handling.
7. **Frontend:** Create authentication context for managing user state.
8. **Frontend:** Implement protected routes that require authentication.
9. **Security:** Implement password hashing using bcrypt or similar secure methods.
10. **Security:** Configure JWT with appropriate expiration and secret key management.

## UI Design:

### Registration Form:
* Full Name (Text Input)
* Email Address (Email Input with validation)
* Password (Password Input with strength indicator)
* Confirm Password (Password Input with matching validation)
* Role Selection (Dropdown: Student, Staff)
* Register Button
* Link to Login page for existing users

### Login Form:
* Email Address (Email Input)
* Password (Password Input)
* Remember Me (Checkbox)
* Login Button
* Link to Registration page for new users
* Forgot Password link (future enhancement)

### Security Features:
* Form validation with real-time feedback
* Password strength requirements display
* Error messages for invalid credentials
* Success redirect after authentication
* Automatic logout on token expiration
