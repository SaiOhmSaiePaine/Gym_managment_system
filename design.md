# Lost & Found Campus - Design Documentation

## Project Overview

The Lost & Found Campus system is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the process of reporting, searching, and claiming lost items within a university campus environment. The system provides students and staff with an intuitive platform to post found items, search for lost belongings, and facilitate secure item returns through a verified claim process.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript and Material-UI v5
- **Backend**: Python 3.8+ with custom HTTP server implementation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on DigitalOcean cloud platform
- **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 for image storage with boto3 SDK integration
- **Authentication**: JWT-based security with bcrypt password hashing

### Database Design

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The database schema consists of the following core entities:

- **Users**: Student and staff accounts with authentication and profile management
- **Categories**: Hierarchical item categorization with parent-child relationships
- **Items**: Found item records with detailed descriptions and location data
- **Item Images**: Multiple image support for each found item
- **Claims**: User claim requests with verification and approval workflow
- **Notifications**: System-wide notification management for user communications
- **Audit Logs**: Comprehensive activity tracking for security and monitoring

#### Key Relationships
- Users have one-to-many relationships with Items (posted items)
- Users have one-to-many relationships with Claims (submitted claims)
- Items have one-to-many relationships with Claims (multiple claims per item)
- Items have one-to-many relationships with Item Images (multiple photos)
- Categories have self-referencing relationships for hierarchical structure
- All entities link to Audit Logs for complete activity tracking
