# Campus Lost & Found - CP3407 Project 2025

## Project Overview

This project is a web application designed to help students and staff manage lost and found items on the JCU campus efficiently. It serves two primary user groups:

* **Finders:**
    * Easily post details and photos of items they have found.
    * Specify where and how the item is being kept.
* **Seekers:**
    * Quickly browse or filter through listed found items.
    * Get information on how to potentially reclaim their lost belongings.

Our main goals are to build a secure, user-friendly, and reliable system utilizing cloud storage for item images and a robust database for item information.

## Project Goal
* Our goal is to build a simple Lost and Found website for our school. When someone finds a lost item, they bring it to the Lost and Found Center. The staff will take a photo of the item and upload it to the website.This way, students who lose something can easily check the website to see if their item has been found.
