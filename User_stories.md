### Post a Found Item | **Priority:** High | **Estimate:** 4 days

**Description:**  
As a registered campus member (student or staff), I want to be able to easily post details of an item I have found on campus, including its name, a description, a picture, where I found it (block and level), and how I am currently keeping the item. This will help others who have lost items to find them.

### Filter Found Items by Status | Priority:** Medium | Estimate: 2 days

**Description:**  
As a campus member looking for a lost item, I want to be able to filter the list of found items based on how the item is being kept (e.g., "Sent to One Stop Center") so I can more efficiently search in relevant places or for items I can directly inquire about.

### View and Search Found Items | Priority: High | Estimate: 4 days

### Mark a Posted Item as Reclaimed | Priority: Medium | Estimate: 3 days

**Description:**  
As a registered campus member who has previously posted a found item, I want to be able to update the status of that item to "Reclaimed" once the rightful owner has collected it. This will help keep the list of actively lost items accurate and reduce unnecessary inquiries.
