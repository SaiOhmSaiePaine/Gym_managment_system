### Post a Found Item | **Priority:** High | **Estimate:** 4 days

**Description:**  
As a registered campus member (student or staff), I want to be able to easily post details of an item I have found on campus, including its name, a description, a picture, where I found it (block and level), and how I am currently keeping the item. This will help others who have lost items to find them.

### Filter Found Items by Status | Priority:** Medium | Estimate: 2 days

**Description:**  
As a campus member looking for a lost item, I want to be able to filter the list of found items based on how the item is being kept (e.g., "Sent to One Stop Center") so I can more efficiently search in relevant places or for items I can directly inquire about.
